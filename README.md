# Arcade-Shooter-Unity-Game
This project was created for the Programming and Problem solving 2 course. The game was programmed in Unity 3D and C#. 

The game is an arcade style, top-down, shooter where the player is attempting to stay alive as long as possible. The game is split up into phases or "Rounds" where enemies spawn and the player has to pick up weapons and ammo and defend themselves for as long as they can. 

This project is not deployed and finalized and is meant to be an archive for viewing program source files. 

To view the C# source files navigate to /ProjectOne/Assets//Scripts
